# My Knowledge Base
I created this little repo to maintain my knowledge base which basically consists of what i call life savers.

Usually they save me a lot of time and i want to share them with you.

The knowledge base can be found [here](http://mkb.segidev.com/)

> No guarantee for anything here of course :)
