# My Knowledge Base
I created this little repo to maintain my knowledge base which basically consists of what i call life savers.

Usually they save me a lot of time and i want to share them with you.

The knowledge base can be found [here](http://mkb.segidev.com/)

## Usage
Fire up docker with docker-compose by
1. Calling `docker-compose up -d`
2. Visit [http://localhost:8001/](http://localhost:8001/)

Hot reloading should work out of the box.

## Deployment
1. `npm run docs:build`
2. Deploy the website at [./docs/.vuepress/dist](docs/.vuepress/dist) to your server.

> No guarantee for anything here of course :)
